        "# QR Code Decoder Using Deep Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "I embarked on the challenge of creating a QR code decoder entirely based on deep learning—a task that is more complex than it might initially seem. Unlike the usual image classification tasks like the conventional cat vs. dog classifier, this project posed a unique challenge due to the inherent complexities in QR code encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why is it challenging?\n",
        "\n",
        "QR codes contain several elements that introduce noise, making it difficult for AI models to decode them accurately:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Error Correction Codewords**: Reed-Solomon error correction adds redundant data to the QR code, creating noise that has no direct mathematical relationship with the encoded data.\n",
        "2. **Data Masking**: This process alters bits of the original binary data to improve readability, further complicating the decoding process.\n",
        "3. **Timing Patterns**: These patterns help scanners determine the QR code's size but add another layer of complexity for the AI to decipher.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the challenges, I developed a deep learning model based on the EfficientNet family, using AutoKeras for hyperparameter tuning. The model, with a size of 90MB, required about 7 hours of GPU computation to train. While the best cross-validated mean absolute error I achieved was 21,000—a less-than-ideal result—it was still the most effective model I could create under the circumstances.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project pushed the boundaries of what's possible with AI in decoding noisy, structured data, and I'm excited to explore this further. I'll soon be releasing a YouTube video that visualizes the architecture of this deep learning model in 3D."
